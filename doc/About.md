# What is HyTEST?

The Hydro-Terrestrial Earth System Testbed (HyTEST) Organization is a community 
promoting open, reproducible, and scalable approaches to all facets of the hydrological 
modeling enterprise. Initiated as a collaboration between the U.S. Geological 
Survey (USGS) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), this 
organization seeks to build a diverse community of researchers and developers that 
focus on general challenges in the discipline, creating an interdisciplinary team 
that cuts across academia, government, and industry.

Following the successful approach of the Pangeo Community, instead of building 
monolithic software environments, we seek out tools and approaches widely used in the 
open-source development community. We add value by testing them on our domain-specific 
workflows and by contributing enhancements, building an ecosystem that supports open 
and reproducible science. This approach has a range from short-term to long-term 
benefits by leveraging contributions by others, maintaining flexibility, and being
future-proof. With a broad and diverse community of developers, users, and stakeholders, 
there will be a pathway for whatever the future brings.

## About the HyTEST Repository
The HyTEST organization encompasses a multitude of repositories, however the hytest 
repo is where users can find demos, tutorials, and explanatory Jupyter Notebooks for 
common scenarios encountered in the hydrologic and atmospheric modeling fields. These 
common scenarios cover development, evaluation, and visualization of small to large 
scale modeling simulations on computational environments such as the cloud, high 
performance computers, or local environments.

## How to contribute?
The HyTEST Organization is excited to foster collaboration amongst members and newcomers.
We hope to hear more about cases of real-world applications of HyTEST workflows, workflow 
improvements and suggestions, bug fixes, demo and tutorial additions. We are happy to grow 
membership in HyTEST and connect with developers and researchers that aim for similar 
principles of open-source, reproducible science.

If you have bug fixes, suggestions, ideas for helpful tutorials or demos, course material, 
or want to share new developments in the hydrologic and atmospheric software community, 
please submit an issue to our main repo, hytest. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to 
HyTEST members with any questions or problems with submitting an issue to the repo.
