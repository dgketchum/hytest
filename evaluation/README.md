# Evaluation folder

The evaluation folder contains demos, tutorials, and resources for evaluating
model and forcing datasets. These datasets are not so different from one
another, as model outputs can be inputs for other models. An example is
CONUS404, a model output, contains forcings data variables that are used
in additional models.

An example can be found in the CONUS404 DRB tutorials, which go over the
process for evaluating forcings inputs (accumulated precipitation, net
radiation, and mean temperature) of a model ouput (CONUS404).

The *Metrics* notebooks above provide an overview of the different stats
that are used in various notebooks.

If you are new to the technologies found in these notebooks, review the
[essential_reading](../essential_reading) directory for additional
resources.
